                <h3> Water sports </h3>
                <p> if you're near a beach or a large body of water, surfing or wakeboarding are a great souce of exercise. 
                    <br> If you're looking for something more laid-back, kayaking or paddling boarding is a great thing 
                    <br> to do with friends, and rental centers are pretty easy to find. </p>
            </li> 
            <li data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-duration="1000" class='outcard'> 
                <h3> Skating </h3>
                <p> Skating comes in various forms, including rollerskating, ice-skating, skateboarding, 
                    scootering, and many more. Parks are great places to learn, and if you're looking for something 
                    more active, skate parks are a great way to expand your skills. If wheels aren't quite for you, hiking or rock climbing 
                    are both easy sports to get into and are great for any age.</p>

                <h3> Public Events </h3>
                <p> Go online and look up events in your area, like art, food, or music festivals, farmers markets, or events hosted by small businesses. Another good option to get out and meet new people is going to places like dog parks or joining a local sports club. You can oten find more laid back ones that focus on the fun more than the competition. </p>

        <ul>
            <li data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1000"class='incard'> 
                <ul>
                    <li><h3>Learn to solve twisty puzzle</h3></li>
                        <p> There are so many different types with an incredibly wide range of difficulty, and they can be a fun collectable for any price range.</p>
                    <li><h3> Start an at home yoga or work out routine</h3></li>
                        <p> A good way to relax and decompress for any body type.</p>
                    <li><h3>Balisong Flipping</h3></li>
                        <p> While this one sounds a little more dangerous, I like to think of it as a fidget spinner with higher stakes. Naturally you'd want to start with a trainer blade that's flat, but it's a fun pass time and an interesting and unique skill.  </p>
                </ul>
            </li> 
            <li data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1000" class='incard'>
                <ul>
                    <li><h3> Audio books </h3></li>
                    <p> If sitting down and reading isn't really for you, try putting on an audio book while you do other things, like cycling or menial tasks like cleaning or homework. </p>
                    <li><h3>Build a model</h3></li>
                    <p>This ones great for people with any interest in aviation, cars, trains, etc. Going to a hobby shop, pickng out your favorite model and setting aside time to build it is a fun activity that gives you something to show off at the end of it, and is diverse in it's difficulty ratings.</p>
                    <li><h3>Learn Chess</h3></li>
                    <p>...or maybe something that takes less time to get good at. Various board or card games can be played online, and puzzle-based video games can be super addicting and are a great brain exercise.</p>
                </ul>
